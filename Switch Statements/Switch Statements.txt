Switch Statements-- provides a more streamlined and elegant way to test and compare a variable for equality against a list of values

Case - each value is called a case. The switch checks each case until a case is matched.
cases are labeled "case" follwed by the variable and a colon, and then the statement that will be executed if the case is matched.

Default - an optional case that can be added to the end of the switch statement that will be executed if none of the previous cases are matched.

Break - the break statement is included after each of the cases, to terminate the switch statement if a match is found.

Example from the video - Based on a characters intelligence level, the switch statement will determine which greeting is used.

    public int intelligence = 5;
        
        
        void Greet()
        {
            switch (intelligence)
            {
            case 5:
                print ("Why hello there good sir! Let me teach you about Trigonometry!");
                break;
            case 4:
                print ("Hello and good day!");
                break;
            case 3:
                print ("Whadya want?");
                break;
            case 2:
                print ("Grog SMASH!");
                break;
            case 1:
                print ("Ulg, glib, Pblblblblb");
                break;
            default:
                print ("Incorrect intelligence level.");
                break;
            }
        }
    }


Switch Statement example -- reaction to traffic light color.

    string light = "green";

    switch (light){
        case "red":
            print("The light is red--STOP for crying out loud!!!");
        break;
        case "yellow":
            print("thelight is yellow--Slow Down!!");
        break;
        case "green":
            print("the light is green--Go Dog Go!");
        break;
        default:
            print("that's not a valid color.");
        break;
    }

Switch Statement examples: 

    int cardNumber = 13

    switch(cardNumber){
        case 13: 
            Console.Writeline ("King");
        break;
        case 12:
            Console.Writeline ("Queen");
        break;
        case 11:
            Console.Writeline ("Jack");
        break;
        default:
            Console.Writeline (cardNumber);
        break;
    }

    switch (cardNumber){
        case 13:
        case 12:
        case 11:
            print("Face card");
        break;
        default:
            print("Plain Card");
        break;
    }



    switch(x){
        case 10:
            print("TEN");
        break;
        case 20:
            print("TWENTY");
        break;
        default:
            print("No match");
        break;

    

    int x = 33;
        switch(x){
            case 8:
                Console.Writeline("Value is 8");
            break;
            case 18:
                Console.Writeline("Value is 18");
            break;
            case 33:
                Console.Writeline("Value is 33");
            break;
        }
    


    string name = "Ryan"
    switch(name){
        case "Ryan":
            print("Ryan has brown hair");
        break;
        case "Maddie":
            print("Maddie has red hair");
        break;
        case "Josh":
            print("Josh has blonde hair");
        break;
        case "Adam":
            print("Adam has no hair");
        break;
    }
