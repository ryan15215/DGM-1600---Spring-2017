Loops -- Statements that can efficiently repeat a statment. often refered to as iterating.
4 types of loops:
    For loop - good for repeating a certain number of time.
    While loop - good for repeating while a conditional remains true. tests for condition at beginning of the body.
    Do-While loop - good for repeating while a conditional remains true. tests for condition at end of the body. -- going to run at least once.
    For Each loop - good for iterating through collections like arrays. loops through a collection item by item until it reaches the end of the collection.

Example of while loop from video - the program will decrease by 1 cup and say "I've washed a cup" as long as there are cups in the sink.

    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;

    public class WhileLoop : MonoBehaviour
    {
        int cupsInTheSink = 4;
        
        
        void Start ()
        {
            while(cupsInTheSink > 0)
            {
                Debug.Log ("I've washed a cup!");
                cupsInTheSink--;
            }
        }
    }

Example of do-while loop - Even though the condition is set to false, "Hello World" will still print, because do-while loops always run at least once, because the check for the condition at the end of the body.
        
        using UnityEngine;
        using System.Collections;

        public class DoWhileLoop : MonoBehaviour 
        {
            void Start()
            {
                bool shouldContinue = false;
                
                do
                {
                    print ("Hello World");
                    
                }while(shouldContinue == true);
            }
        }

Example of for loop from video - loop will run while i is less than numEnemies, and will print "creating enemy number:" + i
   
    public class ForLoop : MonoBehaviour
    {
        int numEnemies = 3;
        
        
        void Start ()
        {
            for(int i = 0; i < numEnemies; i++)
            {
                Debug.Log("Creating enemy number: " + i);
            }
        }
    }

Example of for-each loop from video:

    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;

    public class ForeachLoop : MonoBehaviour 
    {   
        void Start () 
        {
            string[] strings = new string[3];
            
            strings[0] = "First string";
            strings[1] = "Second string";
            strings[2] = "Third string";
            
            foreach(string item in strings)
            {
                print (item);
            }
        }
    }

For Loop example-- 99 bottles of beer on the wall

    public int bottles = 0;

    for(int i=99;i>bottles;i--){
        print(i+"bottles of beer on the wall");
    }

While Loop examples assignment:

    while(ammo < 12){
        ammo++;
        print ("Loading round" + ammo);
    }



    int i = 0
    while (i< 3){
        Console.Write (i++);
    }



    while(money <$1000){
        money++;
        print "You've earned" + money;
    }


    int num = 1;
    while(num < 6){
        Console.WriteLine(num);
        num++;
    }


    int x = 42;
    int num = 0;
    while(num < 3) {
        Console.WriteLine(x);
        num++;
    }


    int num = 0;
    while(num<100){
        Console.WriteLine(num);
        num+=2;
    }


    int num = 0;
    while(++num < 6){
        Console.WriteLine(num);
    } 


For Loop examples assignment:


    for (int x = 10; x < 15; x++){
        Console.WriteLine("Value of x: {0}", x);
    }


    for (int x = 5; x < 10; x++ ){
        Console.WriteLine(x);
    }


    for (int cups =7; cups < 0; cups--){
        print "You've washed 1 cup, there are" +cups print "left in the sink";
    }


    for (int x = 0; x < 10; x+=3)
        {
        Console.WriteLine(x);
    }


    for (int x = 10; x > 0; x-=2)
        {
        Console.WriteLine(x);
    }


    for (int x = 50; x > 25; x--){
        print "The value of X is" (x);
    }


    for (int x = 0; x < 100; x+= 2) {
        Console.WriteLine(x);
    }


Foreach Loop example assignment:

    foreach (char c in "beer"){
        Console.WriteLine (c + " ");
    }


    string[] pets = { "dog", "cat", "bird" };

        foreach (string value in pets){
            Console.WriteLine(value);
        }
