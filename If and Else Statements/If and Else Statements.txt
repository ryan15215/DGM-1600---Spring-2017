Example of drinking coffee and waiting for the right temperature from video
        float coffeeTemperature = 85.0f;
        float hotLimitTemperature = 70.0f;
        float coldLimitTemperature = 40.0f;
        

        void Update ()
        {
            if(Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space))
                TemperatureTest();
            
            coffeeTemperature -= Time.deltaTime * 5f;
        }
        
        
        void TemperatureTest ()
        {
            // If the coffee's temperature is greater than the hottest drinking temperature...
            if(coffeeTemperature > hotLimitTemperature)
            {
                // ... do this.
                print("Coffee is too hot.");
            }
            // If it isn't, but the coffee temperature is less than the coldest drinking temperature...
            else if(coffeeTemperature < coldLimitTemperature)
            {
                // ... do this.
                print("Coffee is too cold.");
            }
            // If it is neither of those then...
            else
            {
                // ... do this.
                print("Coffee is just right.");
            }
        }
    }
